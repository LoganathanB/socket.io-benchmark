Simple socket.io benchmark.


For now, each client sends a message to the server, which sends it back to the same client, which repeats the process forever.


Instalation:
1) 'git clone git@github.com:michetti/socket.io-benchmark.git'
2) on created dir, 'npm install -d'
3) set ulimit 'ulimit -u <desired ulimit>'

* set ulimit to increase max number of opened sockets.

Run:
1) Start server: 'node app.js'
2) Start clients: 'node benchmark.js <users> <rampup in seconds> &'

Users will be added at an <users> / <rampup> rate.
Ex: 'node benchmark.js 1000 100' -> 100 new users per second, until 1000 users are connected

It is better to repeat step 2 many times than run it with a lot of users, since node is monothread.

Run 'node responsetime.js' to see a more precise response time. It will connect another user, that will log the response time in miliseconds. The benchmark.js also logs response time, but it is an approximation.

TODO:
*) Specify transport on app.js command line.
*) Specify broadcast/echo behavior on app.js command line.
*) Make benchmark.js fork new processes to run clients, instead of running the script multiple time.


I'm quite new to all this. Any help is appreciated.
